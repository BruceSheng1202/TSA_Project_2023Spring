# TSA_Project_2022June
This is the project detail in the course Time Series Analysis taught by Yingxing Li in Xiamen University.

This project mainly reports the theoretical modeling of the FOCuS(Romano et al., 2023) method and compares different change point detection methods based on data construction fron (E. T. McGonigle and H. Cho, 2022) through R programing. These methods include, but are not limited to: FOCuS(Romano et al, 2023), WCM.GSA(H. Cho and Fryzlewicz,2021), MOSUM.TAVC(E. T. McGonigle and H. Cho,2022), WBS2(Fryzlewicz,2020), CUSUM (PAGE,1954), MOSUM(HorvÂ´ath et al., 2008 & Aue et al., 2008), PAGE-CUSUM(Fremdt, 2014) and mMOSUM(Chen and Tian, 2010).

The conclusion of this project is that FOCuS(Romano et al., 2023), as an online change point detection method implemented by traditional statistical methods, has a superior performance in detection accuracy and feedback speed compared with other previous methods. 

Here we knit the code involved in the project from Rmd files into html files to display in the file Ag+AmN_1.html.
